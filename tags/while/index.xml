Which one is best?
for I know how many repeat needed Cannot repeat with certain condition (need to use if and break) Hard to use previous result to next repeated loop Good usage example : print numbers in array. while I do not know how many repeat needed repeat with certain condition Hard to use previous result to next repeated loop Good usage example : count how may words you typed recursion I know how many Stack Memory that will use repeat with certain condition Easy to use previous result to next repeated loop Good usage example: find 88th&amp;rsquo;s Fibonacci number additional considerable conditions Does your programming language provide tail recursion Program environment such as embedded, Android, or Web Conclusion</description></item></channel></rss>
